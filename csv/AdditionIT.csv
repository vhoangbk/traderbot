Kristoffer still has some issueswith the replacement workflow.

Could you see if you canreproduce this error, Kristoffer is using an attribute that he has added to theschema by himself so there may be a permission issue, I’ve not had the chanceto verify that myself.

Does this work for you if youare using attributes that already exist in fim?

I’ll try to explain a little closer to help you recreatewhat we’re doing.
If we use a Request MPR to replace already configuredattributes (such as sn), everything works fine.
We have created an MPR, type Transition In, in which we usea set for users without sn.
This MPR calls a Workflow in which we use the replacecharacters workflow.
The MPR, set and workflow are specified below.
When we import a user (in this example he’s called KentÖdvall) or add him to the set, we get a post processing error and no sn is set.

MPR: Set Transition _Create sn for new users
Transition  Set: Users Without sn
Policy Workflow: _Replace characters sn workflow

Set: _Users Without sn
Criteria: sn not starts with % 

Workflow: _Replace characters sn workflow
Activities Replace Characters Activity

Put some config information inthe beginning of the script, that is fine.

I’ll try and get some samplesfor you.

I’d also like you to verify theformat of the csv file before importing, and aborting if it is not correct.

If possible I’d like the scriptto create a log file with both the old and updated values for the persons thatwere updated.

The script will be run as ascheduled task, and the account running the script should have the necessarypermissions in sql to do the updates.

I’ve got a database with a couple of tables, Employees,ApprovedEmployees and FimEmployees.

I need to update ApprovedEmployees and FimEmployees withvalues from a CSV file.

This update should only happen if the Employees table doesnot have a specific status set on the person that has an update in the csvfile.

Can you make a powershell script that does that for me?

Hello Hai,

You've looked in to the possibilities available to modifythe authentication for self service password reset.

Is it possible to replace the entire out of boxauthentication workflow with one that does authentication via smartcards/certificates instead in order to allow a person to reset their password?

we will get some more info on how to use the database today
  

  

 

 

  

  
they have created a utility (dll) that contains functionality to write to the db that we need to use
  

  

 

 

  

  
it is called DBProxy, I still don't know how we are supposed to read from the database though

ok great, thanks.

Great,
I'd like to let the customer in to the test environment to get feedback, is
that possible?





We
also need to move the sites/services that will be used for production in to
another Azure subscription and decide on names for the sites and services and
map custom domains to them.





I
just tested to visit the alcar.azure... site on an ipad and I got the mobile
version of the site, I think I'd rather get the full version, perhaps with a
link at the bottom to switch between mobile/full site experience?





For
the employee web site, we should add a help link so that the users can get to
the documentation they need to understand how to use the system.

The customer doesn’t have the FIM Service / Portal so wealso need to create an appropriate metaverse extension.

Can someone in the dev team create the necessary PowerShellscripts and the other code needed so that I have a sample with me to thecustomer so I don’t have to figure everything out on site? And the appropriatedocumentation.

3. Read this email:
Hello!
I've been looking at the GUI and I have a little inputthere, mostly cosmetic.
Most of the time all the words begin with upper caseletters. If that is to be used, I believe it should be used throughout thesite. As the headline in Administration Portal, where I can Manage Access ToSSPR Portal. 
In Group management, Combination management and Level, aspace would do nicely in the name of the column (i.e Level Name instead ofLevelName and so on).
On the Config for QA Gate site, it's missing an""s"" in ""Answer conStraint"" and ""Descriptionanswer conStraint""

And for the group management, where I can Create/UpdateGroup, I think it should say “Add User Manually”, since that’s what I’dwant to do instead of adding a user manual.

If we jump a bit forward, I get a code in my mail or phone.When I get to the place to enter that code, I think it should read more like“Enter the code you received in the SMS/Mail”

And finally, the password reset. The box where I’m allowedto enter my new password is the Final Step, not the Finish Step.

about assign licenses and plans, what is the behavior if a user belongs to multiple groups?


Jesper Lönnqvist

I think the best would be if we build a multivalue attribute (maybe just in memory) for each user, and add the licenses as we iterate through groups just adding them on, then when it is done we apply the list of licenses to office 365, is that possible ? or do you have other ideas?

1. CS of PS connector and MV: in the CS, there's only person object type. The person object type has ADLicenses attribute and O365Licenses attribute, there're these two

attributes in the MV too.

2. Import.ps1:
- Get list of users in O365. Get O365Licenses attribute.
- For each user: get list of groups that user belongs to (using GetGroupsOfUser method).
- Map user's groups to O365 License. Set this value to ADLicenses attribute.

3. Export.ps1:
- Read O365Licenses and set licenses, plans for user according to this value.
----------------
New solution (see attachment):
- CS of PS connector and MV: inthe CS, there's only person object type. The person object type hasADLicenses attribute and O365Licenses attribute, there're these two attributesin the MV too.
- During import: get licenses from O365, set to O365Licenses attribute. Get groups from AD, map groups to licenses, and set licenses to ADLicenses attribute.
- Then flow from CS -> MV.
CS ADLicenses -> MV ADLicenses
CS O365LIcenses -> MV O365Licenses
- Then flow from MV -> CS
MVADLicenses -> CS O365Licenses
--------------------
Old solution (do not use):
- Import script: Import group memberships from ad using recursive (http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee617193.aspx).
- Import group memberships to groupMemberships attribute in MV (using Attribute Flow?).
- Change the groupMemberships attribute in MV (?).
- Update the members attribute CS of MS PS (using Attribute Flow?).
- Run delta export to update person in O365.
----------------------
From Jesper: what if we during import reads group memberships from ad, to theuser object, import them as a multivalued attribute to the metaverse,
and then do an attribute flow from licensegroup -> the o365connector attribute that we use to assign licenses? then that should trigger ifit there is a change, should it not?

Hello, sorry about the delay.
  I'm actually not sure about what you mean. But if I look at a users  properties in MV, the attribute is a GovIssueId. But instead of a string,  it's a reference to the actual manager's MV object. Was that what you were  asking for?

5277,Product Backlog Item,Heroma: Using OrgNiva3 instead of Organisationsspecifikationsbenämning,Nguyen Hoang Ngo,Done,,\,"-----From Kristoffer----------
Hello!
As mentioned earlier, the Heroma connector needs an update. 
It turns out that the “Organisationsspecifikationsbenämning”that we turned in to a multi value attribute isn’t the one to use. Instead, itshould be populated from OrgNiva3.
However, OrgNiva3 is still needed as it is, so we can’tchange that into a multivalue attribute.

/Kristoffer

------To do-------
- Change Organisationsspecifikationsbenämning to single value.
- Add aimOrgNiva3 to the schema (multi value).
- Values for aimOrgNiva3 are from OrgNiva3.
- Value for aimEmpOrgUnitText1 is from OrgNiva3 (Huvu = J).

--------Solution-----------
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/543995/replicating-visual-studio-com-registration-with-a-wix-installer
I recently ran into this issue, and the simplest workaround I could find follows these steps on the development machine:

 *  Run: Regasm MyDLL.dll /tlb:MyDLL.tlb
 *  Run: Heat file MyDLL.dll -out MyDll-1.wxs
 *  Run: Heat file MyDll.tlb -out MyDll-2.wxs

MyDll-2.wxs contains a <Typelib> element that you will want to copy and nest inside the <File>element that was generated in MyDll-1.wxs. This will give you a complete <Component> element that you can use in the installer project.

5992,Product Backlog Item,SSPR: Update doc about SSPR service accounts,Hai Ba Tran,Done,,\,"Hello Hai,

I have a question regarding the service accounts used by SSPR.

What I understood was that:

A Database Access Account is used to grant read/write access to the SQL database that SSPR uses.
An Application Pool Account for the Administration Portal, this account also needs permissions in Active Directory to reset user passwords.
An Application Pool Account for the Password Register and Reset Portals.

But when I did the new installation and tried resetting users passwords I needed to give the Password Registration/Reset Application Pool Account permissions in AD. I thought the backend administration portal/service did all the communication with AD?

Also when I install the portals, and select Windows Authentication in the installation wizards, the installer uses the application pool account for DB access, I’d like to use a separate domain account as the DB Access Account, is that possible?

Since I used Windows Authentication for DB access in the current install that I’ve got running, I needed to give both application pool accounts access to the database, I thought that only the administration portal needed access to the DB?

We need do document this properly, how shall we set up service accounts and what permissions do they need in order to provide maximum security?

I sent the above explanation to the customer so they could prepare the environment we’re going to install in, but I was clearly wrong.

I’ve looked at the latest documentation and I’ve got acouple of questions.

In the heading “Config User Access to the WCF Service”.
Is this section really necessary?

Under EMAIL GATE MANAGEMENT
The web.conf settings are explained instead of theconfiguration in the portal.

The Logging section is missing.

The Portal Configuration is not in the document.

The screenshots of the portal is old.


I will add some information to the documentation now, butI’d appreciate if you could read through the document when you start work andcorrect things that might be wrong, remove stuff that is not current.

I’ll download a copy of the document to bring with me at0600.

6141,Product Backlog Item,SP: Delta Export only sends the managers GovIssueID and nothing else,Nguyen Hoang Ngo,Done,,\,"Hello!
I was told byRobin that there is a problem with Karlskrona’s Powershell-connector.
The problem, as Iunderstand it, is that Delta Export only sends the managers GovIssueID andnothing else.
This means thatthere is nothing that specifies where the new managers id should be updated.
If we run a FullExport, no changes are being sent. So we can add and remove manager on newobects, but we can’t change it on alreade existing objects.

When we run aFull Export, nothing happens (we get ma-extension-error).
So, what we wouldlike to be exported in a DE is username, managers GovIssueID, Identity andQuarantine flag.

in the GetCapability method,  there's an parameter MAExportType
  

  

 

 

  

  

  

  

  
if it's AttributeUpdate,  only changed attribute are pushed to the code
  

  

 

 

  

  

  

  

  
it should be ObjectReplace  to push complete objects to code

Hello, when the customer  tries to reset password they get an unspecified error has occured
  

  

 

 

  

  

  

  

  
this is a user that has been  registered for QA gate before but now is supposed to use SC gate
  

  

 

 

  

  

  

  

  
how to I delete users from  the database so they can start over?
  

  

 

 

  

  
Hai Ba Tran
  

  

  
delete that user from the  Users table
  

  

 

 

  

  
Lönnqvist Jesper
  

  

  
ok, that's all that has to  be done
  

  

 

 

  

  
Hai Ba Tran
  

  

  
yes
  

  

 

 

  

  

  

  

  
did they pass the SC gate?
  

  

 

 

  

  
Lönnqvist Jesper
  

  

  
he enters his name, clicks  next, gets an unspecified error has occured
  

  

 

 

  

  

  

  

  
I guess that QA  configuration has been deleted and the user is still saved in the database as  a QA user

For aGovIssueId that is 196408233234, we use 640823323to calculate the last digit.

- Validate Person number before export using Checksum and format ""YYYYMMDDNNNK""

yes, if we implement this, I  guess that we have to authenticate the user, then check if the account is  locked out and if it is, then give the user the possiblity to chose

currently, an inactive user  still can reset password but cannot log in
  

  

 

 

  

  

  

  

  
I'll add code to check if  the user is active
  

  

 

 

  

  

  

  

  
if not, do not allow the  user to reset pwd

Is there any way to optimize the delay? And/or at least show an hour glass, spinning wheel or something that indicates to the user that something is happening behind the scenes.

----------
Authentication is implemented using VB.NET.
When the user enters user name and password to the login and submit, the server code will verify that the user name exists by using FindByIdentity method (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb344891(v=vs.110).aspx). Then the server code will call ValidateCredentials method (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb154889(v=vs.110).aspx) to verify the credential. If the credential is valid, the SetAuthCookie method (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.security.formsauthentication.setauthcookie(v=vs.110).aspx) is called to set the authentication cookie and the user passes the authentication step.

I recently tried to set up a  new demo environment and tried to change the password, and got a response  that my password wasn't valid
  

  

 

 

  

  

  

  

  
this was because the  password policy didn't allow me to change passwords more than once a day

ok

ok

- If the import run type is “Full Import”: set avtalsid = 54594 and get all non-updated users. Then set avtalsid = 54593 to get all updated users. All updated and non-updated users will be put into CS.

- If the import run type is “Delta Import”: set avtalsid = 54593 to get all updated users.

---------Kristoffer-----------
Hello!
54593 is used for getting updated users and 54594 is for those who arenot updated.
Since a user can only have one value, there is no way of getting allusers. 
So we have to do two imports in order to get all users.

And yes, we can test it at their machine today. But since import hasoccurred today, it’s not certain that we’ll get anything.

/Kristoffer
---------------------------

I'dlike you to verify a thing in Heroma. We are currently having an issue if Iunderstand it correctly has to do with full/delta imports.

Heromadetermines what kind of import we want to do by using the avtalsid inconfig.

Thereare two different id to choose from, one gives us all users but not with thelatest updates and one gives us the updated users since last night or somethinglike that.

Currentlywe only import the delta one cause we need the latest updates, but if someoneis missing in that delta we can not get it back.

Wouldn'tbe possible to modify the connector so that when a full import is executed theconnector first looks up all users using one id and then looks up all theupdates using another id. And then writes everyone to the connector space?

Andif a delta import is run, only deltas get imported.

I'veonly got this issue explained to me so it has to be verified. Can you look intothat?

The customer has an AD with three domains and two separateSharePoint 2013 farms, one in Sweden (MR) and one in Belgium (Group / The Hub).

In the Swedish site (MR), around 5000 users has been usingSharePoint for a couple of years and they have created SharePoint profiles witha number of attributes. Now the customer is launching a new global intranetcalled The Hub, in this site most of the SharePoint profiles are empty/notcreated.

The customer would like us to set up FIM Sync to create /manage / synchronize SharePoint profiles in both environments.

We should use the SharePoint Connector from Microsoft ifpossible, but I need help setting this up, documenting the solution, writingtest cases and code the missing pieces. The customer has around 45000 users soperformance is kind of important.

I’m currently trying to write a complete specification ofwhat attributes they want us to sync, and what systems should be master for thedifferent attributes and so on. But I think it would be good if you can prepareyour development environment with two SharePoint farms so we can get startedconfiguring/coding as soon as possible. And perhaps read up on the SharePointConnector/User Profile Management.

We need to find out how to import existing profiles fromSharePoint MR, export this to SharePoint Group, and then allow users to updatetheir profiles in Group and sync that back to MR. We also need to import someattributes from AD, which will be the easy part. And then we need to make surethat we can manage new users.

This solution is supposed to go live next week, so we don’thave much time. If we can pull this off, we will be heroes ;)

I’ve set up a project site where I’ll save alldocumentation, https://addition.sharepoint.com/sites/projects/14p20,you should have access to that site.

Let’s do a status chat tomorrow morning (my time) and talksome more about this.

- Verify cert:

+ build X509Chain

When the user mouses over ""Click here for more information"" the ""attacker's"" Javascript code is executed. Javascript code replacing Action for the form, so that the data really should be sent to SSPR server, sent to https://www.certezza.net/pwdreset.aspx.

Hello!
I don’t think that STRPAR should be removed completely. Only when OID is1. STRPAR points to the parent object and OID 1 means that it is the rootobject and has no parents. 
So if OID=1 then there should be no STRPAR.

--------Chat with Jesper-----------

 

  

  
Hai Ba Tran
  

  

  
regarding SPSM, we are  trying to get it up and running
  

  

 

 

  

  

  

  

  
could you tell  me what  the purposes of this project?
  

  

 

 

  

  
Lönnqvist Jesper
  

  

  
SPSM is using a FIM solution  to provision employees.
  

  

 

 

  

  

  

  

  
Their managers use the  webportal that I've created to initiate an employment, this webportal  generates an employment contract using SQL reporting services and the data is  imported to FIM
  

  

 

 

  

  

  

  

  
then an AD account is  created along with a number of other systems such as Agresso Resource,  Agresso User, Marvin, Lync, Exchange
  

  

 

 

  

  

  

  

  
the purpose of handing this  over to you is that I'm not a developer, so making the webportal takes me to  long, and the code is not good enough even if it seems to work ;)
  

  

 

 

  

  
Hai Ba Tran
  

  

  
:) it seems to be a  compicated system
  

  

 

 

  

  
Lönnqvist Jesper
  

  

  
I'd like you to be able to  continue development, add features as they come in, and I'd like you to be  able to manage the fim solution and connectors as well
  

  

 

 

  

  

  

  

  
This way, we can have lets  call it a first line support/contact in Sweden, but you can configure/develop  the requested functionality in the solution for the customer.
  

  

 

 

  

  
Hai Ba Tran
  

  

  
ok
  

  

 

 

  

  

  

  

  
does this system simulate  scenario of one of your customer?
  

  

 

 

  

  
Lönnqvist Jesper
  

  

  
Right now, the customer  wants us to add functionality for managing consultants and one other kind of  employee type in the web portal among other things
  

  

 

 

  

  

  

  

  
SPSM is the customer
  

  

 

 

  

  
Hai Ba Tran
  

  

  
ah, ok
  

  

 

 

  

  
Lönnqvist Jesper
  

  

  
they have also purchased the  IST Extens connector, so soon we will be adding support to fim to manage  students as well as employees
  

  

 

 

  

  
Hai Ba Tran
  

  

  
does it use FIM portal or  FIM service or any other components?
  

  

 

 

  

  
Lönnqvist Jesper
  

  

  
it uses fim sync, fim  portal, fim reporting in addition to the spsm.webportal and sql reporting  services
  

  

 

 

  

  

  

  

  
and a bunch of connectors
  

  

 

 

  

  
Hai Ba Tran
  

  

  
ok
  

  

 

 

  

  

  

  

  
so to get it up and running  , we will need to configure SQL Reporting service so that it works with FIM  REPORTING?
  

  

 

 

  

  
Lönnqvist Jesper
  

  

  
I think for the development  environment right now you need, spsm.webportal, fim sync, fim service
  

  

 

 

  

  

  

  

  
this will allow you to build  and test the spsm portal, develop/test new connectors/synchronization rules
  

  

 

 

  

  

  

  

  
the customer has a test  system that we can use to verify things in their environment, it is not a  complete replica of their production (it uses the same AD as production) but  some of the systems are available in there.
  

  

 

 

  

  
Hai Ba Tran
  

  

  
ok
  

  

 

 

  

  

  

  

  
is that all the things we  should start in this phase?
  

  

 

 

  

  
Lönnqvist Jesper
  

  

  
start tearing the  spsm.webportal apart to try to understand what I've written ;) and we will  start with adding/replacing functionality in that, connect that to fim  sync/fim service/AD so you can create users in ad and update them according  to the values/data in the spsm.webportal
  

  

 

 

  

  
Hai Ba Tran
  

  

  
ok
  

  

 

 

  

  

  

  

  
we have FIM sync, fim  service and fim portal ready
  

  

 

 

  

  
Lönnqvist Jesper
  

  

  
we can do a walk through of  the production environment via lync if you want
  

  

 

 

  

  
Hai Ba Tran
  

  

  
now we will get th  spsm.webportal up and running
  

  

 

 

  

  
Lönnqvist Jesper
  

  

  
ok, then it is just the spsm  portal you need
  

  

 

 

  

  
Hai Ba Tran
  

  

  
that's great
  

  

 

 

  

  

  

  

  
I'll study the system first
  

  

 

 

  

  

  

  

  
then I will need your walk  through
  

  

 

 

  

  
Lönnqvist Jesper
  

  

  
ok, tell me when you have  time and we'll schedule a walk through
  

  

 

 

  

  
Hai Ba Tran
  

  

  
yes, thanks

I’ve been looking at the new connector and it works almost as I want itto.
The only thing is the post “Tilltalsnamnsmarkering” that doesn’tgenerate an additional ;. Even though there is no data exported to the column,it should be there.
Now, if I import the data, I’ll get Fornamn underTilltalsnamnsmarkering, Mellannamn under Fornamn etc..
The field Tilltalsnamnsmarkering is configured inaddition.AIM.Connector:heroma.config, so as far as I can tell, it should bethere.

This is the documentation on the Allabolag webservice.

We want to be able to import new customers using this webserviceand we want to be able to update customers using this webservice.

We are only allowed 1500 queries per month so we cannotcontinously update all customers unless we subscribe to a change service thatis listed in the documentation I think, I don't know how much that coststhough.

http://blog.kayako.com/working-with-v4s-remote-authentication-loginshare/

---------------------

I'd like us to enable single-sign-on for Kayako, as I understand it, this requires that we develop something since they use a proprietary authentication protocol.
Hai Tran
6:09 PM
did you mean that you want to log in to Kayako using addition-it account?
Jesper Lönnqvist
6:08 PM
yes
As a staff user in Kayako, I'd like to use my addition-it credentials
this can be either AD or Azure AD
Hai Tran
6:10 PM
O365 use an open protocol, Ws-federation or OAuth
Jesper Lönnqvist
6:10 PM
https://kayako.atlassian.net/wiki/display/DEV/LoginShare+For+Staff
As I understand it, Kayako can redirect to an external website that does authentication and then expects a response back.
If we can deploy a web site to Azure that does authentication against Azure AD then we should be able to get it to work.
Hai Tran
6:11 PM
it seems that
from the link , it seems support ldap
Jesper Lönnqvist
6:12 PM
ldap is not an option since there is no LDAP server available on the internet

some more info here
https://kayako.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=4816953
Jesper Lönnqvist
6:14 PM
do you think it is possible to create a web app that receives the auth request from kayako and authenticates against Azure AD?
Hai Tran
6:15 PM
yes, I think so
Jesper Lönnqvist
6:15 PM
ok, have a look at it when you get the time.
and we'll talk about it when you have an idea on how to implement it.
Hai Tran
6:16 PM
yes, it's interesting :)
I'll do it
do you use it for your company or do you a new customer?
Jesper Lönnqvist
6:16 PM
I'm trying to minimize our different usernames/passwords that we use internally
Hai Tran
6:17 PM
ok
Jesper Lönnqvist
6:16 PM
and I want us to use two factor authentication, this way we should be able to get that to work in Kayako as well
Hai Tran
6:17 PM
what is the second factor?
Jesper Lönnqvist
6:17 PM
we're rolling out Azure Multi Factor
the second factor can be OTP via SMS, Phone call, or a smart phone app
Hai Tran
6:18 PM
do you use SMS or token hardware or something else?

Reopen:
- Redirection works but an exception is still written to ELMAH.
- Expected: no exception is written.
- Try this solution: using URL rewrite (http://www.iis.net/learn/extensions/url-rewrite-module/using-rewrite-maps-in-url-rewrite-module)

Jesper Lönnqvist
  

  

  
2:12 PM
  
ok, I've got a couple of things, but one that you could  start with is extension code to get and set the different bits in the  userAccountControl attribute in active directory
  

 

 

  

  
Hai Tran
  

  

  
2:13 PM
  
is it FIM extension code?
  

 



 

  

  
Jesper Lönnqvist
  

  

  
2:13 PM
  
this is an attribute that sets a number of different  functions on an account, from account enabled/disabled, locked out and so on,  it is all represented by a bit in the value, I need a way to get and set this  in different attributes in an AD MA.
  

 

 

  

  

  
yes, it is AD MA extension code
  

 



 

  

  

  
this is part of a larger solution that we need to  develop, but this is a first step that we need to figure out
  

 

 

  

  
Hai Tran
  

  

  
2:14 PM
  
is it an extension code to run in export/import attribute  flow?
  

 



 

  

  
Jesper Lönnqvist
  

  

  
2:15 PM
  
I'd like to be able to import userAccountControl with an  advanced flow, specify what bit value I need, for example account enabled and  flow that as a boolean to an attribute of my choosing in MV, such as  userEnabled
  

 

 

  

  

  
yes, it needs to translate import and export attribute  flows
  

 



 

  

  

  
and the other way, I'd like to be able to flow a boolean  from MV and set a specific bit in CS/AD
  

 

 

  

  
Hai Tran
  

  

  
2:17 PM
  
so
  

 



 

  

  

  
what we need to do is an extension code to:
  

 

 

  

  
Jesper Lönnqvist
  

  

  
2:18 PM
  
I don't know if this is possible, but that is what I'd  like [qrc://emoticons/wink.png]
  

 



 

  

  
Hai Tran
  

  

  
2:18 PM
  
- Import flow: from attribute value of AD, set a boolean  value to an attribute in MV
  

 

 

  

  

  
- Export flow: from a boolean value in MV, set a value to  attribute in AD connector
  

 



 

  

  

  
is it correct?
  

 

 

  

  
Jesper Lönnqvist
  

  

  
2:21 PM
  
yes, that is the basic, the trick is that the attribute  in AD, is one attribute that contains all the info, represented by each bit  in that value. I want to be able to split this info in to different  attributes in MV. so on an import I will have multiple advanced import flows,  all use userAccountControl in AD as source, but different bits, and will  import to different attributes in MV, such as userEnabled, userLockedOut,  userNeedsToChangePassword
  

 



 

  

  
Hai Tran
  

  

  
2:22 PM
  
ah, now it's clear to me
  

 

 

  

  
Jesper Lönnqvist
  

  

  
2:22 PM
  
http://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/305144
  

 



 

  

  
Hai Tran
  

  

  
2:22 PM
  
from one attribute in AD, you want to set values to  multiple attributes in MV
  

 

 

  

  
Jesper Lönnqvist
  

  

  
2:23 PM
  
yes, I want to get parts of the source AD attribute and  translate that to a specific attribute in MV, and I'd like to be able to use  just one value from userAccountControl or many if needed for the specific  customer
  

 



 

  

  
Hai Tran
  

  

  
2:24 PM
  
I see
  

 

 

  

  
Jesper Lönnqvist
  

  

  
2:24 PM
  
And the other way around, I'd like to be able to export  userEnabled, userLockedOut, UserNeedsToChangePassword, to userAccountControl
  

 



 

  

  
Hai Tran
  

  

  
2:24 PM
  
so I think I will write a Proof of concept for this  feature first
  

 

 

  

  
Jesper Lönnqvist
  

  

  
2:24 PM
  
the link above describes userAccountcontrol in more  detail
  

 



 

  

  
Hai Tran
  

  

  
2:24 PM
  
to make sure it's possible
  

 

 

  

  
Jesper Lönnqvist
  

  

  
2:24 PM
  
sure
  

 



 

  

  
Hai Tran
  

  

  
2:25 PM
  
ok
  

 

 

  

  
Jesper Lönnqvist
  

  

  
2:25 PM
  
it should be possible using different rules in the  extension code to determine what bit we import/export
  

 



 

  

  
Hai Tran
  

  

  
2:26 PM
  
yes
  

 

 

  

  
Hai Tran
  

  

  
2:27 PM
  
is it about the extension code?
  

 



 

  

  
Jesper Lönnqvist
  

  

  
2:27 PM
  
yes, this will be extension code to an AD MA
  

 

 

  

  
Hai Tran
  

  

  
2:28 PM
  
ok, I'll take a look at it today
  

 



 

  

  
Jesper Lönnqvist
  

  

  
2:29 PM
  
great

10014,Product Backlog Item,FIM: Unattended installation for FIM,Nguyen Hoang Ngo,Done,,\,"- See acceptance criteria
- Todo


+ FIM Sync service (done)
+ FIM Service
+ FIM Portal (SharePoint)



- Jesper: First step is to get AD, SQL, Sharepoint, fim up and running, next step is to fill the solution with sample data, and perhaps some of our connectors. and make sure that functions such as sspr, group management and so on is working properly.
if you do the installation via powershell, lets make it modular so we can install one component at a time and then we can tie the scripts together if needed to install everything automatically

Jesper Lönnqvist
  

  

  
2:30 PM
  
another thing I'd like us to take a look at is unattended  installations of FIM development environments so we quickly can get a  development environment up and running
  

 



 

  

  

  
I'll send you an email regarding AC
  

 

 

  

  
Hai Tran
  

  

  
2:31 PM
  
thanks
  

 



 

  

  

  
we can install FIM sync service unattended
  

 

 

  

  

  
I think we can do the same for FIM service
  

 



 

  

  
Jesper Lönnqvist
  

  

  
2:33 PM
  
I think all components support unattended installation,  but in order to get FIM up and running we need other components/servers, such  as AD, SQL, SharePoint, perhaps Exchange and so on
  

 

 

  

  
Hai Tran
  

  

  
2:34 PM
  
ok
  

 



 

  

  

  
I'll take a look at them
  

 

 

  

  
Jesper Lönnqvist
  

  

  
2:35 PM
  
preferably this should be able to build both on Hyper-V  and in Azure, but I don't know if that is possible using the same type of  scripts
  

 



 

  

  
Hai Tran
  

  

  
2:35 PM
  
ok
  

 

 

  

  
Jesper Lönnqvist
  

  

  
2:36 PM
  
Have a look at http://infoworks.tv/tag/workplace-vnext/ for inspiration
  

 



 

  

  

  
or http://deploymentbunny.com/2013/01/04/hydration-kit-v3-is-out/
  

 

 

  

  
Hai Tran
  

  

  
2:37 PM
  
ok
  

 



 

  

  
Jesper Lönnqvist
  

  

  
2:38 PM
  
And lets talk about the components we want, and what we  should start with, on-premise or Azure, or if we can do both easily.
  

 

 

  

  
Hai Tran
  

  

  
2:38 PM
  
yes
  

 



 

  

  
Jesper Lönnqvist
  

  

  
2:40 PM
  
when the software components are installed, I want us to  load it up with sample data as well, so that we get a working solution  directly, that we always know the status of (what users are available, what  rules we have in place, what software is available and so on) then we can use  it for both development and demos of FIM functionality
  

 

 

  

  

  
we might even include some of our connectors
  

 



 

  

  

  
but lets start with the standard components
  

 

 

  

  
Hai Tran
  

  

  
2:41 PM
  
it's a great idea
  

 



 

  

  

  
I'll do it
  

 

 

  

  
Jesper Lönnqvist
  

  

  
2:42 PM
  
good, MDT (Microsoft Deployment Toolkit) might also be of  use, but if we can do it all in powershell / remote powershell then I think  it will be easier to use with Azure.

10443,Product Backlog Item,FIM: Workflow activity and userAccountControl,Nguyen Hoang Ngo,Done,,\,"See the email below and attached.
-----------------------
Hi Hai,

I’ve got a customer that needs a workflow that disables auser in Active Directory. This is kind of urgent.

The customer has two AD’s (Red and Green) and we user FIM tosync users between them.

Green is the source, when a user gets created there, it willget created in Red, as a disabled user. This is done with built-in rules.
The Red user is manually activated outside of FIM.

Here comes the tricky part.
If the user gets disabled in Green, the user should bedisabled in Red, and require manual activation.

In order to achieve this my thought is to use some pieces ofcode.
The first piece will be used to import userAccountControlfrom Green and get a Boolean if the user is enabled or disabled.
If the user has the disabled attribute set to true, then hewill fall in to a set in the FIM service that will trigger a workflow activitythat disables the user in Red.

We might be able to manage the userAccountControl flags withthe built-in BitAnd custom expression for sync rules, and apply that instead ofwriting our own code.

But I can’t think of  any built-in function that willmanage the user disable step in red so there we will need a workflow activity.

What do you think?

/Jesper

- Is itpossible to only get the disable user functionality in a dll? Hai
- is there any otherway to register the dll in the gac not using gacutil
- Thedocumentation also states that the Administration: Administrators controlconfiguration related resources MPR should be changed to All Attributes, thisis not advisable, one should not grant more permissions than the ones required.
- TheActivityInformationConfiguration section in the document also states that allthree workflow types should be checked, action, authorization andauthentication, this is not true
- I’vemanaged to create the workflow and the mpr’s and so on, and the workflowtriggers when it is supposed to, and it disables the user in the destinationdomain, but there is a PostProcessingError on the workflow itself in the FIMportal, so something is wrong.

So import stops with the error message “Table ‘vvGYEleverMeta’ missing.I’m sure it would complain about vvPersonalMeta and vvVuxEleverMeta as well ifit got past vvGYEleverMeta.
Is there a possibility to add the functionality where one can choosewhat tables to import?
